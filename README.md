# ProjectAPI - Jikan.

This website is powered by Jikan, which is an unofficial MyAnimeList API. Kei Reports is a blog where you can find the upcoming animes for the seasons of Spring and Summer. There is information about titles, star airing dates, what type of media are, and pictures, mainly official art from the anime. The same goes to the Top 50 Manga, the difference here is that you can find the Top 50 manga according MyAnimeList ranking.

In this repository you will find everything that was need it to develop it, and inside the code there are commented lines which mainly they are to check a specific step. Variables are added in CSS and the JavaScript pieces that we can find are loops, functions, if statements, spread operator to join different arrays into one, event listeners, math function, among others.

The logo for this blog was created separately and added onto the website, following basics of CSS animations. 

A PDF document is included into this repository with Kei Report's wireframes.
